# Distributed-Networks
A project to compute the existence of a fault tolerant path between the source and destination

## Motivation: 
Earlier only 1 fault in a 2D mesh could be tolerated and upto 2 faults in a 3D mesh.
We realized that it is not just these nodes that are faulty and hence can't be in the path between source and destination, but also those that are rendered useless and unreachable due to these faulty nodes.
